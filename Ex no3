markOne = int(input())
markTwo = int(input())
markThree = int(input())
markFour = int(input())
markFive = int(input())

tot = markOne+markTwo+markThree+markFour+markFive
avg = tot/5

if avg>=90 and avg<=100:
    print("Your Grade is O")
elif avg>=80 and avg<90:
    print("Your Grade is A+")
elif avg>=70 and avg<80:
    print("Your Grade is A")
elif avg>=60 and avg<70:
    print("Your Grade is B+")
elif avg>=50 and avg<60:
    print("Your Grade is B")
else avg<50:
    print("Your Grade is U")

   print("Maximum is {c}")
else:
   print(a)

Output:
Maximum is (b)
